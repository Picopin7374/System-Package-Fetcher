# Welcome to System Package Fetcher!
Hello there, curious user! Welcome to the System Package Fetcher project. It's a nifty utility we built using Bash scripting, and it's all about helping you get a handle on your Linux system's package infrastructure. It's your one-stop solution to display all installed packages, and it's designed to support a wide array of package managers. We're talking Flatpak, npm, pip, AUR Helpers like yay, paru, pacmac, pacaur, trizen, and of course, snap, and Portage. And for the system-level pros out there, we even threw in pacman, apt, dnf, zypper, and many others!

## Features
Cross-Compatibility: We're pretty proud of this one—our script can play nice with a whole bunch of package managers across the myriad Linux distributions out there.

Detailed Output: We believe in clear communication. That's why, as the script fetches information, it gives detailed feedback. It lets you in on each step and process, so there are no mysteries and everything's transparent.

Error Handling and Logging: Because peace of mind matters, our script stays vigilant, checking for the presence of the required package manager before starting a fetch operation. Plus, if errors occur during the activity, rest assured, it'll catch them and let you know right away.

Customizable Output: Want to keep a record of the fetched package details? The script has you covered with a handy option to write output to a file.

## How to Use It
Using System Package Fetcher is as easy as pie. Just type bash <script_name.sh> in your terminal—substitute <script_name.sh> with the actual file name of the script. Hit enter and voila, it will sprinkle your console with detailed output, letting you in on what's happening at each juncture.

## Tweaks
Who doesn't love options? If you want to customize how the script shows you the output, tweak the OUTPUT_TO_FILE and FILE_NAME variables in the script as per your liking. If you fancy having the output saved to a file, set OUTPUT_TO_FILE to true. You can also designate the filename via FILE_NAME.

## Support
While our script is compatible with most package managers, do double-check the "Features" section for a detailed list. Good news for MacOS users—the script works seamlessly with MacOS's brew package manager as well.

## Error Reporting
For those unexpected hiccups, our script employs on-the-go error reporting. If problems arise or if a specific package manager can't be detected, the script will swiftly handle the issue and give you a friendly error message detailing what went awry.

## Future Work (and that's where you come in!)
We plan to make this script even better, covering even more package managers, and spiffing up its general functionality. We'd be over the moon to hear your suggestions and feedback. Contributions would not just be welcome, they'd be celebrated! Together, let's make this project a helpful tool for Linux users far and wide.
